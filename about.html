              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                Hello World, my name is Raphael Cannavacciuolo I am 21 years old
                and based in The Netherlands, The Hague. At the moment I am
                studying at The Hague university. Following Communication and
                Multimedia Design. I would describe my self as a calm person
                that can keep his head cool, people always tell me I dont know
                stress. Sinds I can remeber I have always been bussy with
                creating and making things. People say I am a positive thinker
                and look at things from the bright side. Also in my spare time I
                like to follow the newest tech news and learn about new
                technologies.<br />
                <br />
                Backstory When I was younger I was always busy building and
                creating things, I played a lot with legos also when was a bit
                older I was always crafting wooden swords, spears, bows, shields
                and play crazy battles in the woods with my friends. When I got
                older I got more interested in technologies. When, I was around
                the age of 11 I played a lot of videos games and also used to
                make my own gameplay videos and edit them into cool
                compilations. This is also where my interested in different
                technologies mostly came from. When I was only 13 years old I
                had built my own Computer with no experience just some YouTube
                videos. Because I played a lot of video games I got really
                interested in how video games were made.<br />
                <br />
                I really liked all the tech stuff from CGI Videos, to 3D
                modeling and Game engines. I got interested in developing and
                coding games but at this point I was more into the art stuff
                especially 3D technologies. I then went to an art school called
                Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam to learn everything about Graphic
                Design and Game Art. The coding scene didn't really get my
                interest until I found out about blockchain technologies from a
                friend in art school. I was really fascinated by this
                technologie and the potentials the technologie could bring. So I
                started to learn everything about it, and got interested in how
                they build and code these blockchains. In the process of
                learning about blockchain I found out about cryptocurrencies. I
                was reading about all these coins on websites, most of these
                websites were really modern and nicely designed, that's where my
                interested started for web design and how I got into UIX and
                Front-end design.
