              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                I'm Raphael Cannavacciuolo, a 24-year-old enthusiast from The Hague, Netherlands. Not too long ago, in December 2022, I graduated from The Hague University with a degree in Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD).
                If I were to describe myself, I'd say I'm a laid-back guy, the kind who keeps his cool no matter what. People often tell me I'm stress-resistant. Ever since I can remember, I've had a strong desire to create and build things. Life has a way of working out, and I tend to see the bright side of things. In my free time, I'm all about the latest tech trends and learning about cutting-edge technologies.</p>
                <br />
                <br>
               <p>Here's a little backstory for you: As a kid, I was obsessed with building things, and Lego was my favorite toy. As I grew older, my interest in tech started to grow. At the age of 10, I was deep into video games, and I didn't just play them – I started making my own gameplay videos and crafting cool compilations. When I was only 13, I embarked on the mission of building my own computer. Armed with nothing but YouTube tutorials and sheer determination, I pieced it together. My love for video games led me to wonder how they were created.</p>

                alt="young men standing in nature"
              />
              <p>I found myself at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, an art school known for its programs in Graphic Design and Game Art. But here's where things took a twist. The world of coding didn't initially catch my attention until a friend from art school introduced me to the fascinating realm of blockchain technology. Its potential left me spellbound, and I couldn't resist delving deeper. My quest for knowledge led me to explore blockchain development and, by extension, cryptocurrencies.
                While diving into blockchain and crypto, I stumbled upon beautifully designed cryptocurrency websites that left me in awe. This newfound appreciation triggered my journey into UI/UX and Front-end design. I was hooked.
                Today, I find myself at the intersection of tech, design, and blockchain, driven by an unquenchable thirst for creativity and innovation. I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects and opportunities where I can put my skills and ideas to good use.

                In my last year of Grafisch Lyceum I did an internship at Team6

                prop and environment artist.
